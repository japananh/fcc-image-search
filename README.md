# Build an Image Search Abstraction Layer

## User stories

- I can get the `images URLs`, `alt text` and `pages urls` for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- I can paginate throughthe responses by adding a `?page=2` parameter to the URL.
- I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

## Source to get images info

You will need to add `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to `.env` file to use Unsplash API.
